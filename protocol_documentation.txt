PDU Types:
- F (FILENAME PDU): Client requests a file from the server.
- D (DATA PDU): Server sends a chunk of the file data.
- L (LAST PDU): Server signals the end of the file transfer.
- E (ERROR PDU): Server reports an error (e.g., file not found).

PDU Format:
- <Type> <Data>

PDU Details:
- FILENAME PDU:
    - Format: F <filename>
    - Example: F sendFile.txt
- DATA PDU:
    - Format: D <file_chunk_data>
    - Example: D This is a chunk of data.
- LAST PDU:
    - Format: L <last_file_chunk_data>
    - Example: L (empty for last chunk)
- ERROR PDU:
    - Format: E <error_message>
    - Example: E File not found

Server Process:
1. UDP Server:
    - Listens for client requests.
    - Receives FILENAME PDU from client.
    - Checks if file exists.
    - If file exists, sends DATA PDUs in chunks of 100 bytes or less.
    - Sends LAST PDU when transfer is complete.
    - Sends ERROR PDU if file not found.
2. TCP Server:
    - Listens for client connections.
    - Accepts connection.
    - Receives FILENAME PDU from client.
    - Sends DATA PDUs in chunks of 100 bytes or less.
    - Sends LAST PDU when transfer is complete.
    - Sends ERROR PDU if file not found.

Client Process:
1. Client Steps:
    - Sends FILENAME PDU to server.
    - Listens for DATA PDUs.
    - Writes received data to a local file.
    - Stops when LAST PDU is received.
    - Handles ERROR PDUs.
2. File Saving:
    - Reconstructs file from received chunks.
